The distinguishing feature of Jitendex is that it can be downloaded and used offline in a variety of formats.

# History

Jitendex began in 2023 and was built using a collection of poorly written Python scripts.
Those scripts have never been published.

Work began in 2025 to rewrite the Jitendex build system. This work is not yet finished,
and new publications of Jitendex dictionary files are still produced using the old system.

This new build system is written in the C# programming language and is publicly available in this GitHub repository.
There are also plans for a web application and API.
